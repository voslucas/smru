# Softmax Recurrent Unit (SMRU)

This repository contains the implementation and most of the experiments of the SMRU as reported in the paper [Softmax Recurrent Unit: A new type of gated RNN cell](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY) by Lucas Vos and Twan van Laarhoven.

## SMRU Implementation

We used an older PyTorch version, before the cuDNN implementations, to code the SMRU as a PyTorch compatible RNN cell. This implementation only provides a CPU based version of the SMRU. 

## Task runner

The task-manager.py provides a class for storing python commands to an Azure Blob Storage location, which can be run by remote machines running task-runner. The jobs can be stored/generated by task-runner.py.
